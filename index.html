    <td><b>knowledge graph construction for intelligent maintainance of power plant &emsp;</b>
        <p>Advisor: <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/hwang">Hongwei Wang</a>, associate professor of Zhejiang University &emsp; &emsp; Apr.2019-Present</p>
        <li>The research project intends to extract knowledge from large number of non-structured
            power plant <br> maintainance report and build knowledge graph based on relation between knowledge</li>
        <li>We manually labeled part of maintainance report and did some experiment by applying <br>
            Bi-LSTM-Lattice model to extract knowledge</li>
        <li>We proposed a framework to build knowledge graph for power plant and our paper gets published <br>
            on conference ICEBE2019, and we are awared as Best Paper of conference.</li>
