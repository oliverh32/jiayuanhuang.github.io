    <p>I'm a junior student at <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute</a>.
    <p>I'm interested in natural language processing, graph recognition and speech recognition. Recently, my team and I are working on knowledge graph construction for intelligent maintainance of power plant.
    <p>I am currently working on my bachelor of engineering degree and am also involved in research and internship programs. Last fall, I went to UIUC for exchange study for a semester, and had a memorable and meaningful time.
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, playing <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/erhu">erhu</a>, and swimming.
    <p>A version of my CV and transcript can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iHUfUgYBPJct3SPqqNbZUy0BtHCSbu1Z/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

    <b>Content</b>: knowledge graph construction for intelligent maintainance
        <li>The research project intends to extract knowledge and data from large number of non-structured power plant maintainance report and build knowledge graph based on relation between knowledge entities.</li>
        <li>We manually labeled part of maintainance report and did some experiment by applying Bi-LSTM-Lattice  model to extract knowledge. Currently we have a relatively good result with applying lattice model on named  entity extraction.</li>
        <li>We proposed a framework to build knowledge graph for power plant and our paper gets published on conference ICEBE 2019, and we are awared as Best Paper of conference.</li>
