    <p>I'm a senior student at <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute</a>.
    <p>I am currently working on my bachelor degree of engineering and am also involved in research and internship programs. Last fall, I went to UIUC for exchange study for a semester, and had a memorable and meaningful time.
    <p>I major in computer engineering and am interested in natural language processing, graph recognition and speech recognition. Recently, my team and I are working on knowledge graph construction for intelligent maintainance of power plant.
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, playing <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/erhu">erhu</a>, and swimming.
    <p>A version of my CV can be found <a href="/CV-Jiayuan.pdf">here</a>.

    <b>Advisor</b>: <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/hwang">Hongwei Wang</a>, Associate Professor of Zhejiang University<br>
    <b>Content</b>: knowledge graph construction for intelligent maintainance
        <li>The research project intends to extract knowledge and data from large number of non-structured power plant maintainance report and build knowledge graph based on relation between knowledge entities.</li>
        <li>We proposed a framework to build knowledge graph for power plant and our paper gets published on conference ICEBE 2019, and we are awarded as Best Paper of conference.</li>
        <li>Recently, we are doing experiment by applying Bi-LSTM-Lattice model to extract named entity on power plant filed, and exploring its advantages compared with other models. We are still working on it and the results would be concluded in a paper.</li>

    <b>Content</b>: knowledge graph complmentation and dailogue system
        <li>The research project intends to complement knowledge graph with state-of-the-art model pretrained with different methods, tring to extract useful information from the corpus these models used to be trained on.</li>
        <li>We are currently working on it and ready to present our achievements in paper.</li>
