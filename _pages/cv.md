Research experience
------
* Summer 2020: Commonsense Knowledge Graph Complmentation with leveraging High-order Structures
  * Advisor: [Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) (UC San Diego)
  * We proposed several approaches which leverage  the  high-order  structure  in  CKGs to  capture  the  high-order  relationships  between  concepts. Human evaluation and automatic evaluation results demonstratethe effectiveness of our methods.
  * Paper in submission to NAACL.
  


* Summer 2019: Knowledge Graph Construction for Intelligent Maintainance
  * Advisor: [Hongwei Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/hwang) (Zhejiang University)
  * Proposed a framework to build knowledge graph for power plant to extract knowledge and data from large number of non-structured power plant maintainance report and build knowledge graph based on relation between knowledge entities.
  * Our paper gets published on conference ICEBE 2019, and we are awarded **Best Paper Award**.
